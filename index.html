    <h3>review</h3>
    <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
    <p>Wait a minute, chocolate is sweeter than peanut butter. But very little sweet,<br>
         eat with peace of mind You can eat it for nothing ;-; Delicious, will definitely buy again</p>
    <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
    <p>It's the most delicious peanut butter I've ever eaten. Watching from Kick-Tock, when I had a chance, I ordered it. I want to <br>
        say that it is highly recommended For people who like peanut butter like us, not too sweet, good chocolate. Apply bread and <br>
        feel very satisfied.
        Unfortunately only ordered one bottle. Next time, order more. Delicious. Recommended.</p>
    <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
    <p>This flavor is a small jar. Open as you can see. I haven't tasted it yet. But after trying it, I have to honestly confess that it's <br>
        really very tasty. This lot is sold out. Stock up again for sure. Teng Chew is crunchy. Not very detailed out of 10</p>
